Hi,

my name is Jan, I'm 31 years old and currently reside in Miami :)
I love learning new things and acquiring new skills, so with the projects outlined below, I'm trying to do exactly that in the 
field of data science and machine learning. 
Also, I enjoy training for -and competing in- triathlons, so if anybody would like to colaborate on a garmin project, let me know :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

## My Projects:
## _1) Pattern recognition in annual reports through Natural Language Processing_
  - #### Data Source:floppy_disk: 
    - Web scraped 507 annual reports of 42 german companies over 14 years (123.687 pages)
  - #### Goals :dart:
    - Analyze differences and similarities between companies or industries
    - Implement my first unsupervised learning algorithm (Latent Dirichlet Allocation):satisfied:
  - #### Tools/ Techniques :wrench: 
    - CRISP-DM process
    - Python (in Jupyter Notebook)
    - Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, spaCy, scikit-learn
    - Webscraping, EDA, DTM, TF-IDF, Latent Dirichlet Allocation
  - #### Insights/ Learnings :eyes:
    - Things you can't escape: Death, taxes and data cleaning :sweat_smile:
    - Interpretation of results > Model implementation (seems as if there's hope for us humans after all)
  - #### Example visualization :bar_chart:

## _2) Investment Dashboard_
  - #### Data Source:floppy_disk: 
    - API call - EOD Historical Data
  - #### Goals :dart:
    - Get familiar with financial data
    - Automate personal finance tracking
  - #### Tools/ Techniques  :wrench: 
    - SQL (in pgAdmin)
    - Python (in PyCharm)
    - "New" libraries: psycopg2, plotly, dash
  - #### Insights/ Learnings :eyes:
    - The earlier you plan your architecture the better
    - Scope creep is real :ghost:
  - #### Example visualization :bar_chart:

 ## _3) Market segmentation of eBay marketplace_
  - #### Data Source:floppy_disk: 
    - webcraping
  - #### Goals :dart:
    - Gain insights into market structure, relevant product categories and pricing 
  - #### Tools/ Techniques  :wrench: 
    - Python (in Atom)
    - Power BI
  - #### Insights/ Learnings :eyes:
    - Able to optimize product placement and portfolio
  - #### Example visualization :bar_chart:

## _4) Reinforcement Learning for financial data (Work in Progress)_
  - #### Data Source:floppy_disk: 
    - API call - Source tbd
  - #### Goals :dart:
    - Train reinforcement learning algorithm (currently evaluating fitness of SARSA) on price movements in various assets/ asset classes 
  - #### Tools/ Techniques  :wrench: 
    - Coming soon
  - #### Insights/ Learnings :eyes:
    - Coming soon
  - #### Example visualization :bar_chart:
    - Coming soon
